# AI Canvas

**AI Canvas** is an interactive web application where users can draw, write text, or enter mathematical expressions on a digital canvas. Using the Gemini API, AI Canvas can decipher written content, convert equations to LaTeX, solve mathematical expressions, and act as an AI-powered calculator.

---

## Features

- **Canvas for Drawing and Writing**: Users can freely write or draw on a canvas.
- **Real-Time Equation Solver**: Recognizes mathematical expressions and evaluates them, e.g., typing `7 + 3` outputs `10`.
- **LaTeX Conversion**: Converts handwritten or typed equations to LaTeX format.
- **AI-Powered Deciphering**: Translates written content on the canvas into text.
- **Gemini API Integration**: Leverages Gemini API for deciphering and analysis of user inputs.
  
## Built With

- **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **Backend**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- **API**: Gemini API for deciphering canvas content.
